The basic simulated annealing algorithm should follow these steps:

Generate a random solution
Calculate its cost*
Generate a random neighboring solution**
Calculate the new solution's cost
Compare them: ***
  If cnew < cold: move to the new solution
  If cnew > cold: maybe move to the new solution
Repeat steps 3-5 above until an acceptable solution is found or you reach some maximum number of iterations.

*Define a cost function
**Start with a simple Neighbor selection
***Define Temperature function
